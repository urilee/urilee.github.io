    <p> ANSWER TO Q2. I tested my website on Google Chrome as my main test. I also used Safari and Firefox. One of the differences that I saw was in the video controls. In Chrome the video controls were seen at the bottom of the video and were fixed. On Safari the play button was seen on the center of the screen and the other controls were not seen until play is clicked. In Firefox, the controls are seen via hover and at the bottom. It is also seen that for the Date of Birth box, Chrome is the only one that provides the formatting of mm/dd/yyyy. In Safari and Firefox, it is seen as a blank box. HERE IS THE ANSWER TO ICE 3: When you click on the text next to each element it does not select the option choice. In order to select the action choice, the user must select the radio bubble itself. The radio buttons also initially did not let you select both a snack and a drink. This matters because it can make it inaccessible for certain users due to the small clickable area. Q7 - No New Issues! </p>


      <p> Thanks for visiting the first ICE. It's probably not that great but hey, I just started really applying my knowledge of HTML and CSS so hopefully the rest of the
      assignments for this class look way better than this. </p>
